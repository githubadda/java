As previously stated, you are responsible for managing the security of your EC2 instance. Below is a short checklist of items to follow when deploying your EC2 instance:
Generate your own key pair and do not share it with other customers or with AWS. Even if they ask nicely.
Disable password-only access for your guests
Utilize multi-factor authentication
Enable key-based SSHv2
Disable remote root login
Use command-line logging
Employ a privilege escalation mechanism (i.e. ‘sudo’)
Update and patch your OS, including security updates
